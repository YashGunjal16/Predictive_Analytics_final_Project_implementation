# 🎥 Predictive Analytics Final Project: MoViNet-Based Human Activity Recognition

Welcome to the official repository for our **Predictive Analytics** final project!  
This project leverages **MoViNets (Mobile Video Networks)** to classify human activities from video clips using deep learning techniques optimized for performance and mobility.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- 📌 **Goal**: To recognize and classify human actions in videos using MoViNet models.
- ⚙️ **Approach**: Use pre-trained MoViNet models with fine-tuning for a lightweight, real-time-ready video classifier.
- 📊 **Outcome**: Efficient activity recognition pipeline that balances performance and computational cost.
